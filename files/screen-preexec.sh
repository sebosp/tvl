# this uses the "preexec" bash script by "Glyph" here:
# http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/preexec.bash.txt

# it makes it more useful (for me) when using screen, by showing either
# the currently-running command (such as "top") or a filename (when
# editing or viewing a file)

# when a command is running as superuser (either by root, or via sudo)
# then it is prefixed with #
